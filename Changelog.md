# Changelog

## 0.3.0.0

- Log files are now written to `%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Codenizer BV\RoadCaptain`. This fixes an issue where log files wouldn't be written at all because RoadCaptain doesn't have write access to the installation directory (`Program Files (x86)\RoadCaptain`)

## 0.2.0.0

In this release you no longer will be asked for your username and password for Zwift, instead you'll be taken to the Zwift website to log in.

This means you won't have to worry that RoadCaptain sees our username and password for Zwift.
