# RoadCaptain

A navigation companion for Zwift. Build and ride your own routes instead of just the predefined Zwift ones!

Tired of riding the same routes over and over? Don't want to click the turn buttons every time and just focus on riding? RoadCaptain is for you!

RoadCaptain works just like your head-unit on the bike, it will tell you when to go left or right but not only that, it will also tell that to Zwift so you don't have to take your hands off the handlebars and can keep putting power to the pedals.

## Limitations

Unfortunately at this time you cannot use the Zwift companion app at the same time as RoadCaptain.
